# Aruk Language Method (ALM)

A new-generation, open-source, anti-memorization language learning method focused on structure, logic, and practical usage.

## ðŸŒŸ Philosophy

- Understand first, use immediately.
- Never just memorize.
- No grammar drills â€” just meaningful input.
- Context is everything.

## ðŸ“˜ What Is ALM?

ALM is a structured JSON-based roadmap to analyze and learn any language (especially non-agglutinative and non-gender ones).

You will:

- Identify language structure
- Recognize verb/subject relations
- Skip abstract grammar memorization
- Focus on building real sentences and using them

## ðŸ§  Language Types Covered

- Agglutinative (e.g. Turkish, Finnish)
- Isolating (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese)
- Fusional (e.g. Spanish, Russian)
