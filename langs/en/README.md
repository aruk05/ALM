# English Learning (ALM)

This folder contains resources for learning **English** with the ALM method.

## Notation

- **tr-en** → *Turkish → English*  
  Means: learning English through Turkish.

- **spanish-en** → *Spanish → English*  
  Means: learning English through Spanish.

- **ru-en** → *Russian → English*  
  Means: learning English through Russian.

## Purpose

Each code (like `tr-en`, `spanish-en`, etc.) represents the **base language** used to explain English.  
The second part (`en`) is always English, since this folder is for learning **English only**.
